### Cheat_Sheet

Number | Action | Shortcut
|---|---|---|
1 | Checking the version of Python in Windows | cmd -> type 'python -V'
2 | Running a python file | cmd -> cd to the root where file is placed -> python <filename>
3 | Opening a .pynb file in D: | open Anaconda prompt -> d: -> jupyter notebook
4 | check the data type in python | type(23) / type ('String')
5 | operators | [+ - * /],   11 % 3 = 3, 11 // 3 = 2, 2**3 = 8, -3
6 | PEMDAS | Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction
7 | Python built-in function | min(1,5,6,7,8) , max(1,2,4,65), abs(-34)
8 | Convert to int, float, str, bool | x = int('223') OR float(10) OR str(10) OR bool(10)...for bool, only the number 0 is False, for strings only empty string is False (even a whitespace is TRUE)...check the outpur using type(x)
9 | help with a function | help(function_name), eg help(print)
10 | defining a function | def <functiion_name>(parameters): code_text return <value_to_be_returned>
10a | : and indentation | very important in python
11 | commenting a line | #
12 | ***Docstrings*** Good Programming practice | It is a triple-quoted string (can span multiple lines) and it comes right below after a function has been named. When we call help() on that function, it shows the docstring. eg  """ This is a description of the function above >>> """
13 | Higher order functions | functions that operate on other functions
14 | 'pass' is a placeholder code  | it can be used inside a function when there is no code, when only the function name is known and zero code has been written  def function_name(): pass
15 | rounding a float | round (number, ndigits) ... default ndigits = 0, it can be negative, it will round to hundreds, tens, thousands
16 | having a default argument in a function | def function_name(x, y=3): ...
17 | Boolean operators | True or False
18 | Boolean operators | ==, !=, <=, >=, <, > 
19 | Boolean expression precedence | `and` is evaluated before `or`
20 | Combining Boolean operators | True and True = True, True and False = False, True or True = True, True or False = True
21 | Conditionals | if <boolean_conditional>:, elif <boolean_conditional>:, else:
22 | what about `if 0:` | python treats this as `if False:` similarly `if '':` is False and `if 1:` or `if 'str':` = True
