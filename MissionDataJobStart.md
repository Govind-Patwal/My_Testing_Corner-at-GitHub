Number | Topic | Comments | Misc
|---|---|---|--- |
0.0 | Python Interview | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEwgZNC-KyE&t=67s | 
0.0.1 | Debugging | when faced with an error, make sure you also check the line above the line w/ error, many times a missed `)` might show up as an error on the next line |
1 | Checking the version of Python in Windows | windows cmd -> `python --version` |
1.1 | Running a python file | windows cmd -> cd to the root where file is placed >>> `python <filename>` OR if coding on VS code, open the file in the integrted terminal, check the terminal should be cmd, and run the file >>> `python <file_name>` |
1.2 | Opening a .pynb file in D: | open Anaconda prompt, on the default c prompt, press d: >>> `C:\Users\user_name>D: ` then >>> `D:\> jupyter notebook` ...this will open the files in D:, open the desired file |
1.2.1 | Data types | integers, floats, strings, booleans ....checking the data types >>> type(2) >>>type(12.23)  >>> type('Star') >>> type(True) | 
1.3 | naming convention of variables | can consist of uppercase, lowercase, digits and underscore - lower case is preferred. Must be in snake case, sample_variable...no keywords to be used, list of keywords >>> `help('keywords')`|
1.4 | file types | text file (can be open in a text editor like notepad, excel)...binary files are written in binary code (power of 2) thus cannot be read with a text editor.
**2** | **Kaggle Course - 1/18** | **Python - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python** |
2.1 | loading the file in python (w/o Pandas)| opening the location of a file ...>>> `import csv` (nextline) >>> `with open(file_path) as data_file:` (nextline) `print(data_file)` |
2.1.1 | reading a file in python (w/o pandas) | opening the data in a csv file >>> `import csv` (nextline) >>> `with open(file_path) as data_file:` (nextline) >>>`data_file_name = csv.reader(data_file)` (nextline) .....iterating over all the rows >>> `for row in data_file_name: (nextline) print(row)` |
2.2 | writing the header of a csv file (w/o Pandas) | >>>`data_file_name = csv.reader(data_file)` (nextline) >>> `headers = next(data_file_name)` (nextline) >>> `print(headers)` ...this also skips the header, we can then iterate through the rows using >>> `for row in data_file_name:` (nextline) 'do something | 
2.3 | writing to a file in python (without Pandas) | >>> `import csv` (newline) >>> `with open('path_of_file_to_save', 'w') as text_file:` (newline) >>> `text_file.write("Hello World")` |
2.4| 3 VERY important functions in python | >>> `type()` (what's type is this object?), >>> `dir()` (what can I do with it) >>> `help()` (tell me more about it) |
2.4.1 | print in python | print(x), help(print), print(x, end =' ' ).....>>> `f' {variable/value} to '` ... f'' in various lines >>> `print(f'{value}' <new_line> f'{value}' <new_line> f'{value}')` ...formatting numbers >>> `f'{value:,.<n>f}'` e.g. >>> `f'{23232232.2323232:,.2f}' ....this will have a thousand comma seperator and 2 digits after decimals |
2.5 | operators | +, -, *, /, % (Modulus/Reminder, e.g. 11 % 3 = 2), // (Floor Division/Quotient, e.g. 11 // 3 = 3, same result as int(11/3)), ** (Exponent, e.g 2**3 = 8) |
2.6 | PEMDAS | Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction |
2.7 | Python built-in function | min(1,5,6,7,8) , max(1,2,4,65), abs(-34) |
2.9 | Convert to int, float, str, bool | x = int('223') OR float(10) OR str(10) OR bool(10)...for bool, only the number 0 is False, for strings only empty string is False (even a whitespace is TRUE)...check the outpur using type(x) |
2.10 | help with a function | help(function_name), eg `help(print)` |
2.11.0 | defining a function | def <function_name>(parameters): code_text return <value_to_be_returned> |
2.11.1 | return | it will break out of the current function, can be used to return if all other options have been exausted wihtout any outcome |
2.12 | : and indentation | very important in python |
2.13 | commenting a line | # |
2.14 | ***Docstrings*** Good Programming practice | It is a triple-quoted string (can span multiple lines) and it comes right below after a function has been named. When we call help() on that function, it shows the docstring. eg  `""" This is a description of the function above >>> """` |
2.15 | Higher order functions | functions that operate inside other functions |
2.16 | 'pass' is a placeholder code  | it can be used inside a function when there is no code, when only the function name is known and zero code has been written  def function_name(): pass |
2.17 | rounding a float | round (number, ndigits) ... default digits = 0, if it is postitive it will round number after the decimal >>> `round(1222123.123345, 2)` -> 1222123.12 ... if it is negative, it will round to 10, 100, 1000 >>> `round(1222123.123345, -2)` -> 1222100 |
2.18 | having a default argument in a function | `def function_name(x, y=3):` ...  |
2.19.0 | Boolean types | True or False |
2.19.1 | Boolean operators | ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >  |
2.19.2 | Boolean expression | `and`, `or`, `not` |
2.19.3 | Membership operators | `in` and `not in`  | 
2.19.3.1 | Treatment of numbers and strings as Booleans | only 0 or 0.0 are treated as False, everything else is True....only '' is treated as False, everything else is treated as True |
2.19.4 | Boolean operator precedence | in the absence of a parenthesis,`and` is evaluated before `or` |
2.19.5 | Combining Boolean operators | True and True = True, True and False = False, True or True = True, True or False = True |
2.20 | Conditionals | if <boolean_conditional>:, elif <boolean_conditional>:, else: ...used with Boolean operators/expression/membership operators|
2.22 | Lists - help(list) | Lists are ordered sequences of values, they are mutable (length and values can be changed). Items in the list can be numbers, strings, lists, variables, or a combination, when no elements are mentioned, it is a empty list |
2.22.1 | List - Indexing | indexing starts at zero, so the first element is [0]...indexing ends at -1 so the last element is [-1] ... the list can be accessed in many ways from [0, ..., -1] |
2.22.2 | List - Slicing, the sliced list is treated as a list | First n elements = list_name[:n], last n elements = list_name[-n:], all elements = list_name[:] Or list_name....when calling list[m:n], it starts from the element at index m...to the element at index (n-1)...just like in range(2,20), so list[4:7] will show elements at index 4 to index 6 = 3 elements |
2.22.3 | List - adding /changing values | simple reassignment, >>> `list[n] = <value>` ... multiple values at one time >>> `list[:5] = [a,b,c,d,e]` |
2.22.4 | List - Finding Lenght | len(list_name) |
2.22.5 | List - Sorting a list in ascending order | sorted(list_name) |
2.22.6 | List - Sum, Min, Max | sum(list), min(list), max(list)
2.22.7 | List - adding 1 element to the end of the list | >>> `list.append(<value>)` |
2.22.7.1 | List - removing the last element of the list | >>> `list.pop()`  |
2.22.7.2 | List - adding item at a specific index | >>> `list.insert(index, value)` | 
2.22.7.3 | List - Deleting an item from a specific index | >>> `list.pop(index)` | 
2.22.7.4 | List - Checking if an item is present in a list | returns True or False >>> `element in <list>`
2.22.7.5 | List - removing the first instance of a value | `list.remove(value)` |
2.22.7.6 | List - returing index of the first occurane of an element in list | `<list_name>.index(<element>)` |
2.23 | Tuples - help(tuple) | Tuples are just like lists. Difference - created using () OR without any opening/clsing brackets AND at least 2 elements - e.g. `<tuple> = <element1>, <element2>` , and are immutable. HOWEVER - The lists inside the tuples are mutable. |
2.23.1 | Tuples - often used for functions that have multiple return values | many functions that return multiple values return the results in the form of tuples...for example, the >>>`<float>.as_integer_ratio()` returns 2 values as tuples; the returned values (a numerator and a denominator) can be assigned to a tuple, eg >>> `numerator, denominator  = <float_number>.as_integer_ratio()` ... same principal is used for swapping 2 variables  >>> `a = 1` (newline) `b= 0` (newline) `a,b = b,a` (newline) `print(a,b)` |
2.23.2 | Tuples - more | initiation >>> `new_tuple =( )`...finding the length >>> `len(<tuple_name>)`...applying indexing operator >>> `tuple[1]`...applying slicing >>> `tuple[:4]`
2.33 | **Loops** | to repeteatedly execute some code |
2.33.1 | for loop | can be used to loop over list, tuple, strings (a string is treated as a tuple) |
2.33.2 | range () | A very important function similar to `for (i, i<10, i++)` in C++. This allows for the code to run for a required number of times. `for i in range(10):` ... also comes in handy as you can have the range equal to the length of a list >>> range(len(list/tuple/dictionary)).. the default start index is 0, but it can by anything else >>> `range(index_start, index_end_plus_one)` |
2.33.3 | while loop | you have to (1) initiate the iterator b4 the loop (2) increase the iterator in the loop...e.g.>>> `i = 0 (newline) while i <20: (newline) do_something (newline) i += 1`  |
2.33.4 | List comprehensions - special loops for lists | works only for `for` loops...NOT with the `while` loop..can use `if` conditionals after for: `list = [<do_this> for <this> if <this>]`, after it is run, it returns the list as well |
2.34 | **Strings** | ...can be used with single or double quotes...if you are using one of the 2 in the string, use the other to encapsulate the string. >>> `print("Canada's capital is Ottawa")` >>> `print('He said "I am excited !"')` |
2.34.1 | String - methods | They can be indexed `'Example'[0]`, sliced `'Example'[:3]`, checked for length `len('Example')`, looped over >>>`for alphabet in 'Example':`, can be used for list comprehension `[alphabet for alphabet in 'Example' if alphabet in ['a','e','i','o','u']]`...like tuples (and unlike lists) they are immutable, PROOF `'Example' == ('Example')` |
2.34.2 | The escape character `\` | >>> `print('He said \"Canada\'s capital is Ottawa\"')` |
2.34.2.1 | Escape character usage | `\' `single quote. `\"` double quote, `\\` backslash, `\n` newline
2.35 | \n newline | added by default in print statement, can be changed >>> `print(<example>, end=' ')` - this will leave just one whitespace between the printed values, unlike the default newline |
2.36 | triple quotes | `'''...'''` or  `""" ... """  ` ... allows to write a string of any length without worrying about lines |
2.37 | String methods | Change to all upper case >>>`<string>.upper()` ...Change to all lowercase >>>`'<string>.lower()` | 
2.37.1 | Other string methods | check the length >>> `len(<string>)` , checking the index of the first occurance of a character >>>`'sentence_to_find_the_character_in'.index('the_character')` also check the 1st occurance of a string`'Example'.index('mple')`, check if the string starts with something `'sentence_to_find_the_character_in'.startswith('string')`, check if the string ends with something `'Example'.endswith('Exa')` | misc
2.37.2 | misc | to check if a char is upper/lower case >>>`'P'.isupper()` |
2.37.3 | swap the case of a string | >>> `<string>.swapcase() ` |
2.37.4 | String - converting a string to a list of independent characters | >>> `list(<string>)` |
2.37.5 | Going between strings and smaller sub strings: **split()** and **join()** | `Split()` is used to split a string into a list, the default point of splitting is a whitespace, other points can be specified - it returns a list of strings (which can be assigned to variables) >>>`e1, e2, e3 = 'Example is here'.split()` or `mm, dd, yy = '1/10/2021'.split('/')`. `join() `is used to join a list of strings into a string, the splitting point has to be mentioned ... >>> `'<new_seperator>.join([string1, string2, string3])` |
2.37.6 | concatenate strings using + | you can add multiple strings into 1 string using >>> `Test1 = 'Example' + ' 23232'`. NOTE - any non string object has to be changed to a string using `str()`  |
2.37.7 | f'string {} ..... ' | can be used to create/ print a string with a varible |
2.37.8 | formattting inside strings | `{<value>:,}` will add a comma seperator... >>>`{<value>:2f}` will give the output rounded to 2 decimals... >>> `{<value>:-2f}` will round to tens/thousands
2.38 | **Dictionaries** | starts and ends in {}, keys and values....and items (key/value pair) ... help(dict) |
2.38.0.1 | 3 rules - 1/3 | (1) keys have to be unique |
2.38.0.2 | 2/3 | (2) keys can ONLY be immutable objects - int/str/float/tuple, but cannot be list/dict |
2.38.0.3 | 3/3 | (3) values can be objects of any type - int/float/str/list/dict/tuple |
2.38.1 | creating dict | >>> `dict1 = {}` or >>> `dict1 = {'key1':value1,'key2':value2, 'key3':value3, 'key4':value4, 'key5':value5}`  |
2.38.1.1 | returning all keys, values and itesms of the dictionary | >>>`<dictionary>.keys() ` >>> `<dictionary>.values()` >>> `<dictionary>.items()` ...output as `dict_keys(['AA', 'BB', 'CC'])`  |
2.38.2 | accesssing a value using key | >>> `dict1['key1']` ... OR >>> `dict1.get('key1')`  |  
2.38.3 | changing value using key >>> `dict1['key1'] = 44` |
2.38.4 | adding new items to a dictionary | >>> `<dict_name>[<new_unique_key>] = value` ... if the key is already present, it will overwrite it| 
2.38.5 | other methods | getting the length >>> `len(<dict_name>)`
2.38.6 | Dictionary comprehension | similar to list comprehension, >>> `new_dict = {i:i**3 for i in range(20)}` |
2.38.7 | using `in` to check for a key in a dict, cannot check for values | `<key> in <dictionary>`, this will return True or False |
2.39 | looping over keys | for loop (by default) loops over only the keys >>> `for i in dict:` ...explicit looping >>> `for i in dict.keys()` |
2.39.1 | looping over values | >>> `for i in dict.values():` |
2.39.2 | looping over keys and values | >>> `for i,j in dict.items():` ... it will return keys, and j will return corresponding values|
2.39.3 | removing an iem | `<dictionary>.pop(<key>)`....eg >>> `dictionary.pop('Name')` |
2.40 | ***Working w/ external libraries*** | way to access them >>> `import pandas`, get help on the libraries: >>> `help(pandas)` , checking all the directories >>> `dir(pandas)`,type >>> `type(dir)` |
2.40.1 | shorten form of an external library | >>> `import pandas as pd`, >>> `import numpy as np` >>> `import tensorflor as tf` |
2.40.2 | Calling variables in a library by it name only | this CAN make life easier >>> `from math import *` >>> `pi` >>> `3.141592653589793`  (this is easier than writing >>> `math.pi` >>> `3.141592653589793`) ... this can ALSO cause bugs which are difficult to detect and fix (especially if you are calling all variables from multiple libraries and they have the same function doing different things), solution (1) call only the methods that you want from a library >>> `from math import log, pi` >>> `from numpy import asarray` (2) use full forms, this will make the code easier to understand and debug |
2.40.3 | accessing submodules | to be accessed by multiple dots, eg. >>> `numpy.random.randint()` |
2.40.4 | While working with external libraries, the 3 most important functions in Python | >>> `type()` >>> `dir() `>>> `help()` |
2.40.5 | Operator overloading | Each library can define its own working with objects. When we do `dir(pandas)`, the methods that have 2 underscores at the start and at the end, e.g. `__getattr__`  are related to operator overloading. |
2.41 | Miscellanous | Miscellanous | 
2.41.1 | ***lambda function*** | is short anonymous functon that can any number of arguments - saves time and effort, syntax >>> `lambda argument_list : expression` ...eg, >>> `lambda x: x*9/5+32` ...this funciton will take `x` as the argument and return x*9/5+32 |
2.41.1.1 | Lambda - w/ a name | like other functions, it has to be called, it can be given a name >>> `my_fn = lambda x:x**3` (newline) >>> `variable = my_fn(5)` | 
2.41.1.2 | Lambda - w/o a name| can be called w/o a name inside another function like map, eg >>> `list(map((lambda x: x**3), [i for i in range(20)]))` |  
2.41.2 | **List of Dictionaries** | is like a 2D table with the keys as the columns and the values as the rows >>> `list_of_dict = [{'Country': 'Canada', 'Capital': 'Ottawa'}, {'Country': 'India', 'Capital': 'New Delhi'}, {'Country': 'USA', 'Capital': 'Washington'}]` |
2.41.3 | List of dictionary - methods | All list methods (len, indexing, slicing, append(), insert(), remove()) can be used to access data...various dictionary methods can also be used in combination with the list methods |
2.41.4 | all permutations of x,y,z using list comprehension | >>> `list2 = [[x,y,z] for x in range(5) for y in range(6) for z in range(8) ]` | 
2.41.5 | converting single line array input into a list | >>> `A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` | 
2.41.6 | converting a string to a list of words | >>> `new_string = <string>.split(" ")` ... joining strings into 1 string >>> `final_string = '-'.join(<old list of string>)` |
2.41.7 | checking if a string is numeric | >>> `<string>.isnumeric()`
2.41.8 | max can be used with a key | >>> max(iterable, key=) ...it will return the element with the max value after the calculation | 
2.41.8.1 | checking for maximum in a dictionary | finding the maximum key >>> `max(dictionary_name)` ... finding the key with the max value >>> `max(dictionary_name, key=dictionary_name.get)`
2.42 | **Python and Object Oriented Programming** | Everything in python is an object, objects carry some things aroud with them, this 'thing' can be accessed using the dot syntax
2.42.1 | Attributes - non-function things attached to an object | eg, numbers in python have a imaginary part, which can be accessed using `print(<number>.imag)` e.g. >>> `print(4.imag)`, the imaginary part of real numbers is 0. Creating an imaginary number >>> `c = 12 + 3j`   (the key is j, nothing else will work), printing the imaginary part of c, >>> `print(c.imag)` |
2.42.2 | Methods - Functions attached to an Object are called  | if you want to access a function, use `<object>.<method>`, eg >>> `4.bit_length`...in order to call the function, use the paranthesis, eg >>> `4.bit_length()` |
2.43 | ** **Classes** ** | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc | 
2.43.1 | Classes - what/why? | Class is an object constructor - can be used to create user defined objects that are used to logically group our data and functions in way that is easy to use/reuse and also easy to build upong if need be, can be used as a 'blueprint' so that we don't have to do it manually for each time |
2.43.2 | Instances | The class (blueprint) is used to create an instance of the class...each unique employee/student record that we create is an instance of the class  |
2.43.3 | Class variables and Instance variables | one way is to create an empty class and then instantiate an instance and create individual instance variable and give them values >>>`class Employee:` (nextline) `pass`  ... instantiating - >>>> `emp_1 = Employee()` ...giving values >>> `emp_1.first = 'Govind'` |

**3.0** | **Kaggle Course - 2/18** | **Pandas - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas** |
67 | Pandas | the most polular Python library for Data Analysis |
68 | Importing Pandas | `import pandas as pd` |
69 | Creating Data | Two core objects in Pandas - the **DataFrame** and the **Series** |
70 | ***Series*** | A sequence of data values or a list >>> `<Series1> = pd.Series(<list>)` |
70a | Optional index and Series name | `Series1 = pd.Series(<list>, index = [...], name ='list_name`)...the series name can act as the column if the series is used to create a df |
71 | DataFrame | it is a Table, contains a 2x2 array of individual entries, each has a certain value. Each enty corresponds to a row (or a record) and a column...***input is mostly a dictionar***y >>> `dict = {'Name':['GSP', 2 ,'DSP'], 'Favorite Color':['Red', 0 ,'Blue']}` >>> `df = pd.DataFrame(<dict>) ` |
71a | Optional index | >>> `pd.DataFrame(<dict>, index = ['index1','index2',...]) ` |
71b | naming the default index column | `df.index.name = '<index_name>'` |
71c | checking the shape of a df | `df.shape` |
72 | **Sample dataset** | https://www.kaggle.com/carlolepelaars/toy-dataset |
72 | reading a CSV file into a df | `pd.read_csv('file path')` |
72a | reading a CSV and using one of its columns as index | >>> `pd.read_csv('file path', index_col=0)`...this is not a very good way as one could end up using a column that has duplicate values(s), thus the index will not be unique |
73 | reading a CSV file in a ZIP file into a df | https://github.com/Govind-Patwal/European_Hotel_Analysis/blob/main/Data_Preprocessing/Step1_Deleting_Null_Values_and_dividing_into_2_tables.ipynb |
74 | checking the shape of a df | `df.shape` |
75 | checking the first and last 10 rows | >>>`df.head()` >>> `df.tail()` |
76 | choosing a column from the CSV as the index | `pd.read_csv('file path', index_col=<column_number>)` |
77 | saving to a CSV file | `<df>.to_csv('<file_path>)` |
77a| w/o the index | `<df>.to_csv('<file_path>, index = False)` |
78 | ***Accessing Data*** |  |
78a | Accessing using Columns | >>>`df['column_name']`, accessing a value (column -> row)  >>>`df['column_name'][<row_index>]`....or first 10 rows of a column >>> `df['column_name'][:10]` |
78b | ***Accessing using Rows index first, followed by column index...iloc*** | >>>`df.iloc[<row_index_number>]` >>> `df.iloc[<row_index_number>,<column_index_number>]`...first 10 rows of a column and 4 columns >>> `df.iloc[:10, :4]`....can also pass any type of list for indexing >>> `df.iloc[[2,4,5,67,8,10],[2,3,4,5]]`...can also be used like >>> `df['column_label'].iloc[0]` |
79 | ***Accessing using Rows index first, followed by column label(s)...loc*** | >>>`df.loc[<row_index_number>, 'column_name']` ...once can also pass a list of column names >>> `df.loc[:, ['column1_name', 'column2_name', 'column3_name']`...can also be used like >>> `df['column_label'].loc[0]` |
80 | choosing between iloc and loc | since iloc is purely index based, 0:10 will return 10 values (0,1....9)....on the other hand loc is label based so both the start and end points are included, so 0:10 will return 11 values (0,1,2...11)...it is specifically good for situations when you want all values returned according to label names...eg df.loc[:,'GradeA':'GradeD'] |
81 | naming the default index column that has no name | `df.index.name = '<index_name>'` |
82 | Removing the default index and replacing with a column in the df (the values in column should be unique) | >>> `df.set_index('<column_name_with_unique_values_in_rows>')` | misc
 83 | Conditional selection | >>> `df['column_label'] == 'Str'/num` ...this produces a series of True/False, which can be used inside a `loc` to select the relevant data |
 84 | Using loc for selecting data based on conditional | >>> `df.loc[df['Column_label'] <conditinal operation>]` |
 85 | using and and or | use the signs `&` and `|` |
 86 | Pandas built in conditional selector - 1/3 | .isin([Value1, Value2, Value3,...]) , it checks if a value is in the list given, for example >>> `df.loc[df['City'].isin(['New Delhi', 'Bangkok', 'Toronto'])]`, it is short form of writing city is in New Delhi or Bangkok or Toronto |
 87 | Pandas built in conditional selector - 2/3 | .between(Value1,Value2)...it checks if a value is between the given range (as in loc, both end points are included), for example >>> `df.loc[df['Salary'].between(50000,80000)]` |
 87 | isnull() and isnotnull() | to check if the value in a column is null or not, for example >> `df['Salary'].notnull()` |
 88 | Assigning data to column(s) | `df['Cities'] = 'New City'` or `df['Salary of Employee'] = 50000` |
89 | Assigning data based on conditions | `df.loc[df['column_label'] <conditional expression>, 'column_name'] = value`, for example >>> `df.loc[df['Income'].between(40367.0,93669.0), 'Income'] = 50000` |
90 | setting the max number of rows to be displayes in a jupyter notebook | >>> `pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 5)` |
91 | **Summary function and maps** | involves operations that we can apply to the data to get the 'desired input' |
92 | some summary functions | >>>`df['column_label'].describe()` >>>`df['column label'].mean()` >>>`df['column label'].min() `>>>`df['column label'].max()` >>>`df['column label'].median()` >>>`df['column label'].count() `>>>`df['column label'].unique()`....to find the name and frequency of unique values >>> `df['column_name'].value_counts()`, returning of the index of the max value in a column >>> `df['column_name'].idxmax()` |
93 | Pandas (operations to create new columns in a jiffy)  | >>> `df['<new_column>'] = df['<column_1>'] + df['<column_2>']` + ' ' ...all mathimatical operations can be done, some more examples >>> `df['<new_column>'] = df['<column_1>'] - df['<column_1>'].mean() |
94 | [Maps and apply](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/summary-functions-and-maps) - ways to to more advanced things likes applying conditional logic, anything needing a function | extremely useful for transforming data into new one |
94a | map() used for a single column /Series | syntax >>> `map(function, iterables)`...IMP-by default it points to the location where the output is saved, in order to see the actual output use `list(map())` or `pd.Series(map())` eg, >>> `pd.Series(map((function, iterable))`...another way of using the map function >>> `<Series>.map(function) `, for example, >>> `df['<column_label>'].map(function)` |
94b | apply() used to transform rows/columns in a df |  >>> `df['column_label'].apply(function)` |
95 | [**Grouping and Sorting**](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/grouping-and-sorting) | using groupby() |
96 | Groupwise analysis - groupby([]) | very handly funciton to group and work with dataframes |
96a | df.groupby(['column_label_1','column_label_2',... ]) | creates a group of similar valued entries from the column in a df, there can be 1 or multiple columns |
96b | groupby() is used with another function that applies some operation to the same or any other column | syntax >>> `df.groupby(['Column(s) to be used for grouping'])['Column_to_be_operator_on'].<operation()>`...eg, `df.groupby(['country','state'])['population'].max())`...functions could be min(), max(), count()...we can also use the pandas function `apply()` can be used with groupby(), [example from kaggle pandas course](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/grouping-and-sorting) or example, here's one way of selecting the name of the first wine reviewed from each winery in the dataset: >>> `reviews.group(['winery']).apply(lambda df: df['title'].iloc[0])` |
96c | agg()...good function to have many funtion run together | `df.groupby(['Column_to_be_used_for_grouping])['Column_to_be_operated_on'].agg[('len','min','max')]`....this returns a dataframe |
96d | more than one columns can be grouped | `df.groupby(['column1','column2',...])['<column_to_be_operated_on>'].<sum/count/min/max()>` OR `df.groupby(['Column1'],['Column2'],...).apply(<function>)` |
97 | Resetting index after multi-group groupby() | `df.groupby(['Column1', 'Column2']).reset_index()` |
98 | Sorting | |
98a | Soring by index |  `df.groupby(['Column1'],['Column2'],...).sort_index()` |
98b| Sorting by single value | `df.groupby([<column(s) to be used for grouping rows],...).sort_values(by=['len'])` OR `df.groupby(['Column1'],['Column2'],...).sort_values(by=['len'], ascending=False)` |
98c| Sorting by multiple values | `df.groupby([<column(s) to be used for grouping rows],...).sort_values(by=['len', <a column used for grouping>])`...eg `df.groupby(['country', 'state']).sort_values(by=['len', 'state'])` ...if we want all descending then use, ascending =False, eg >>> `df.groupby(['country', 'state']).sort_values(by=['len', 'state'], ascending=False)`...can also use size() and sort_values, eg. >>> `df.groupby(['country', 'state']).size().sort_values()` |
99 | **Data Types and Missing Values**| Credit - https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/data-types-and-missing-values |
100 | dtype and dtypes | dtype is for a column, and a dtypes is for df...>>> `df.dtypes ` >>> `df['column_label'].dtype`....strings will show was 'O' meaning object...NOTE: to access the values/types of the index column, use >>> `df.index.dtype` and NOT df['index'].dtype (index is not a column) |
100a | converting datatype of column | >>> `df['column label'].astype('str')`...other formats could be 'float64' 'int64' |
101 | Missing Data | checking the null in all columns of df >>>`df.isnull().sum()`, checking the null in a specific column >>> `df['column_label'].isnull().sum()` ...creting a df based on null in a column >>> `df[pd.isnull(df[<column you want check the null values>])]`...checking for data that is not null >>> `df['column_name'].notnull().sum()` and >>> `df['column_name'].notna().sum()` |
101a | replacing na with something | >>> `df['column_label].fillna('Unknown')`...you can also replace using the mean of the column, or use the backfill strategy (filling each missing with the next non-null) ...replacing non-null with something else >>> `df['column_label'].replace('value_to_replace', 'new_value')`...replace() is also handy when column has data like 'unknown', 'no known', etc, that need to be replaced |
102 | **Renaming and Combining** | Credit - https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/renaming-and-combining |
103 | Renaming columns | renaming column names >>> `df.rename(columns={'column_1_existing_name':'column_1_new_name', 'column_2_existing_name':'column_2_new_name'})` |
104 | naming or renaming the default index column |  >>> `df.index.name = '<new_index_name>'` |
105 | Removing the default index and replacing with a column in the df | >>> `df = df.set_index('<column_name_with_unique_values_in_rows>')` |
106 | resetting the index from 0...-1 | >>> `df.reset_index()` |
107 | renaming index values | changing the first and second index names, ie. index[0] and index[1] >>> `df.rename(index={0:'FirstEntry', 1:'SecondEntry'})` |
108 | renaming both x and y axis | >>> `df.rename_axis('row_axis_name', axis ='rows').rename_axis('column_axis_name', axis='columns')` |
109 | Combining dataframes | used to combine 2 or more dataframes into 1 |
109a | concat()...used when the columns are exactly the same | >>> `pd.concat(['df1','df2'])` |
109b | join() | >>>`left_df.set_index('common_column').join(right_df.set_index('common_column'))` |
109c | merge ()...used when columns are not the same but their is one common column | >>> `new_df = df1_bigger_df.merge(df2_smaller_df, on='common_column')`...NOTE: use the bigger table as df1 |
