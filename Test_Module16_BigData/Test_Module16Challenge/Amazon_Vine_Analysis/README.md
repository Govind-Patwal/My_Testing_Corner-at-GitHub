They are also interested in enrolling in a program that gives out free products to select reviewers but they want to know if it worth the cost. There are thousands of reviews and they are in words not numbersso you"ll have to translate them in order to analyze them. $ellby hired BigMarket because they believe in the power of big data. Now it's up to you to harness that power for your client.

For this project you'll be partnering with Jennifer, an account manager at BigMarket. SellBy, your client, loves to talk about the power of big data, but Jennifer isn't a data expert. So you start off the project by giving her a quick overview of what big data actually is.
