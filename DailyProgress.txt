You are the first data expert at BigMarket, a startup that helps businesses optiomize their markting efforts. and you have been hired just in time too. One of BigMarket's clients has requested some pretty hefty analytics. The client $ellby is about to release a large catelog of products on a leading retail website. they want to kow how the review of their products comapred to the reviews of competitor products sold by their competitors. They are also interested in enrolling in a program that gives out free products to select reviewers but they want to know if it worth the cost. There are thousands of reviews and they are in words not numbersso you"ll have to translate them in order to analyze them. $ellby hired BigMarket because they believe in the power of big data. Now it's up to you to harness that power for your client.

For this project you'll be partnering with Jennifer, an account manager at BigMarket. SellBy, your client, loves to talk about the power of big data, but Jennifer isn't a data expert. So you start off the project by giving her a quick overview of what big data actually is.

Fast Lending, a peer to peer lending services company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Management believes that this will provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. It also believes that machine learning will lead to more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to lower default rates. The company wants me to assist the lead Data Scientist, Jill, in implementing this plan. In your role, I will build and evaluate several machine learning models or algorithms to predict credit risk, I will use techniquest such as resampling and boosting to make the most of my models and myr data. Once I've designed and implemented these algorithms, I'll evaluate their performcance and see how well my  models predict data. To accomplish my task, I will dive headlong into machine learning algorithms, statistics, and data processing techniques.

I and my childhood friend Martha always dreamed about changing the world. so when she gets the chance to pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to her firm 'Accountability Accounting', you jump at the chance to help out. After all, you both think that changing the world is what crytocurrency is all about. As you and Martha both know, the popularity of Bitcoin has caused a price jump that makes it unaffordable for many new investors. However, there are many many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices. Martha has a data set of crypto currencies and can analyze it in any way she wants. It's your job to help Martha discover trends that  will convince her firm to invest in these new currencies. Lucky for both of you and for Martha's firm, ths is the perfect job for unsupervised machine learning.

Beks is a data scientist and programmer for the non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup. They're a philanthropic foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment, improve people's well-being, and unify the world. Alphabet Soup has raised and donated over 10 billion dollars in the past 20 years. This money has been used to invest in lifesaving technologies and organize reforestation groups around the world. Beks is in charge of data collection and analysis for the entire organization. Her job is analyze the impact of each doantion and vet potential recipients. This helps ensure that the  foundation's money is being used effectively. Unfortunately, not every donation the comapany makes is impactful. In some cases an organization will take the money and disappear. As a result, Aphabet Soup's president Andy Glad has asked Beks to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. He wants her to create a mathematical data driven solution that can do this accurately. Beks has decided that this problem is too complex for the statistical and machine learning models that she has used. Instead she will designa and train a deep learning neural network. This model will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision making result. 

In this module, you will help Beks learn about neural networks and how to design and train these models using the Python TensorFlow library. You will rely on your past experience with statistics and machine learning to help test and optimize your models. By the end of this module you will be able to create a robust deep learning neural network capable of interpreting large complex datasets. This model will help Becks and Alphabet Soup which organizations should receive donations.
