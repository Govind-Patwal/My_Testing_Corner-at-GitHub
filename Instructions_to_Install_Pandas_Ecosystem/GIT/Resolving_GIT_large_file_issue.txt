There are time when, unknowingly, a user pushes big files on Git resulting in error (below)
------
remote: warning: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
remote: warning: See http://git.io/iEPt8g for more information.
remote: warning: File <file_name> is 92.91 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB

One of the solutions could be transferring the contents into another folder, deleting the repo, cloning  the repo from GitHub, adding the required changes (without the big file) and then trying pushing again.


There is another simpler solution

------ in the next prompt after the error message, type the following -----------
$ git reset --hard origin

------------remove the large file in question from the repo, and then push the remaining files ---------
