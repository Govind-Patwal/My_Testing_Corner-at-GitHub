# Provisional Machine Learning Model Outline

## Overview
Using our dataset Hotel_Reviews.csv, we will first be putting our selected data into a Postgres database that we will then incorporate into our machine learning models.  This process will combine the positive and negative hotel reviews from the selected data into a single column.  Using our machine learning models, we will predict if the review is positive or negative.

## Machine Learning Model Choice (NLP) - Supervised Learning
Using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to translate text reviews into useable data in our model.
The specific NLP analysis examined will be a Sentiment Analysis that determines if the text is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Which Data is in our dataset and which data from that dataset will we use in our model?
The downloaded dataset is called Hotel_Reviews.csv.  The data inside the dataset/CSV file is listed below.

- Hotel_Address: Address of the hotel.
- Review_Date: Date when the reviewer posted the corresponding review.
- Average_Score: Average Score of the hotel, calculated based on the latest comment in the last year.
- Hotel_Name: Name of Hotel
- Reviewer_Nationality: Nationality of Reviewer
- Negative_Review: Negative Review the reviewer gave to the hotel. If the reviewer does not give a negative review, then it should be: 'No Negative'
- ReviewTotalNegativeWordCounts: Total number of words in the negative review.
- Positive_Review: Positive Review the reviewer gave to the hotel. If the reviewer does not give a negative review, then it should be: 'No Positive'
- ReviewTotalPositiveWordCounts: Total number of words in the positive review.
- Reviewer_Score: Score the reviewer has given to the hotel, based on his/her experience
- TotalNumberofReviewsReviewerHasGiven: Number of Reviews the reviewers have given in the past.
- TotalNumberof_Reviews: Total number of valid reviews the hotel has.
- Tags: Tags reviewer gave the hotel.
- dayssincereview: Duration between the review date and scrape date.
- AdditionalNumberof_Scoring: Some guests just made scoring on the service rather than a review. This number indicates how many valid scores without review in there.
- lat: Latitude of the hotel

## What is the target (the thing we want to predict/column we want to predict) we want to use? - correct output
The target is our y-variable (dependant variable).  This is column M (Reviewer_Score) in our original Hotel_Reviews.csv dataset.

## Which features (columns we are using to aide in that prediction) will we use? - correct input
The feature(s) is our X (independent variable).  This is columns J and G (Negative_Review and Positive_Review) in our original Hotel_Reviews.csv dataset.
