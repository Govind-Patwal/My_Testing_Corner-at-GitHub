### Initial thoughts and strategy
**NLP using PySpark got us the results below**
- For output as decimals: 20.77 %
- For output as integers: 39.62%
- For output as 3 Categories: 77.63%
- For output as Positive or Negative: 91.56%

**We decided to use DeepLearning to see if we could imporve the accuracy**
