# for _ in something # use _ when you are not using in the loop

# for can be used for sequences, lists, tuples, strings # called sequences, iterables

# i is called the for loop variable or iterator variable

# boolean - True or False (upper case)

# print(true)
# print(True)

# False = 0, 0.0 or ''
# True is any other int, float or str
# PEMDAS
# == < <= > >=
# not
# and or

# # usage of enumerate

# # assign values to varable
# text = 'the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'

# counter = 0
# for char in text:
